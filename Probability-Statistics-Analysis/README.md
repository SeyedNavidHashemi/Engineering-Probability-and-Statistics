# Probability and Statistics Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of statistical analysis and probability distributions as part of Engineering Probability and Statistics coursework.

## Overview

The project implements various probability distributions (Binomial, Normal, and Poisson) with practical applications, demonstrating the relationship between theoretical and empirical results through simulation and visualization.

## Features

- **Binomial Distribution Simulation**: Practical implementation comparing empirical vs. theoretical expectation and variance
- **Distribution Comparison**: Analysis of Binomial, Normal, and Poisson distributions under different parameters
- **Probability Calculations**: CDF-based probability computations for normal distributions
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of probability distributions using matplotlib and seaborn

## Files Structure

- `question_1_part_1.py`: Binomial distribution sampling with user input
- `question_1_part_2.py`: Comparative analysis of practical vs. theoretical binomial statistics across probability values
- `question_2.py`: Visualization comparing Binomial, Normal, and Poisson distributions
- `question_3.py`: Normal distribution CDF calculations and probability queries
- `question_4.py`: Distribution comparison with different parameters

## Technologies

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy (Statistical functions)

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```

## Usage

Each Python script can be run independently:

```bash
python question_1_part_1.py
python question_1_part_2.py
python question_2.py
python question_3.py
python question_4.py
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Central Limit Theorem applications
- Convergence of distributions (Binomial â†’ Normal approximation)
- Empirical vs. theoretical statistical measures
- Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF)
- Probability Mass Functions (PMF)
